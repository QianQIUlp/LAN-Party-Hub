## Not Production-Ready Yet

- every included game is still alpha and may need rule, pacing, scoring, UI, and balancing changes;
- persistent storage is not wired for production use;
- no hosted deployment configuration is included;
- no formal end-to-end test suite exists yet;
- controller bundles can be split further;
- several games need deeper playtesting and balancing;
- Firefox phone controllers can sometimes show controller issues around fullscreen behavior, reconnect/session handling, or touch input timing;
- asset and word-list rights need review before any store release.

## Good Next Contributions

- add E2E smoke tests for join, reconnect, round start, and round end;
- improve persistence and restore behavior;
- split controller code by game;
- add more incremental host rendering paths;
- improve docs for each game;
- improve balancing, round pacing, scoring clarity, and player feedback for alpha games;
- add playtest checklists and fixture rooms.
