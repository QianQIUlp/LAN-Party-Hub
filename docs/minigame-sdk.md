# Mini-Game SDK

Each game should provide:

- a package manifest export;
- a server implementation;
- a host view;
- a controller model or layout binding;
- protocol types when game-specific state or input is needed;
- package entrypoints consumed by the platform registry generator.

## Server Contract

Server games generally implement these responsibilities:

- create initial runtime state;
- start a round;
- accept validated player input;
- advance state on ticks or timers;
- decide when a round is finished;
- build score entries;
- expose public state for host and controller rendering.

The exact interfaces are in `packages/game-core`.

## Package Entrypoints

External games must expose stable subpath exports:

```text
@open-party-lab/game-example/manifest
@open-party-lab/game-example/protocol
@open-party-lab/game-example/server
@open-party-lab/game-example/host
@open-party-lab/game-example/controller
```

The platform must not import private files from a game repo.

## Integration Checklist

1. Create or clone the game repo under `local-games/<game-name>`.
2. Add the game to `config/known-games.json`.
3. Export manifest, protocol, server, host, and controller entrypoints.
4. Add or reuse a controller layout in the platform when the existing layouts are insufficient.
5. Run `npm run games:sync-local` from the platform.
6. Update docs and status.
7. Run `npm run typecheck`.
8. Run `npm run build` for release-facing changes.

## Design Guidance

- Use the short game name for new repo and folder names, for example `tap-race`, not an `open-party-game-` prefix.
- Keep simulation state serializable.
- Keep renderer objects out of server state.
- Keep inputs small and explicit.
- Use DOM/React for text-heavy phone controls.
- Use Phaser scenes for host playfield rendering.
- Prefer small vertical changes over broad rewrites.
- Reuse `secret_card` for player-private prompt cards with role badges, forbidden words, timers, actions, targets, scores, and event feeds. The server must omit the card from every unauthorized controller state and from the shared Host state.
- Localize server messages, Host labels, Controller labels, and game-owned content in every platform language; a localized catalog entry alone is not a complete localized game.

## AI Checks

Use the in-app browser for screenshots and visual QA. For local smoke tests that need players, add virtual controllers with:

```bash
npm run ai:controllers -- --room DEBU --players 4 --ready true --hold-ms 600000
```

The virtual controller helper joins real Socket.IO controller sessions and can send arbitrary game input JSON, so it is reusable across games instead of being tied to one title.
