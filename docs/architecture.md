# Architecture

LAN Party Hub is a TypeScript npm-workspace monorepo for local browser party games, derived from Open Party Lab.

## Applications

- `apps/server` is the authoritative Socket.IO server. It owns rooms, players, round timing, gameplay rules, scoring, and lifecycle transitions.
- `apps/host` is the shared-screen Phaser application. It renders the lobby, game select flow, QR join overlay, scoreboards, and game host scenes.
- `apps/controller` is the React phone UI. It renders the player controller for the selected game and sends typed input to the server.

## Shared Packages

- `packages/protocol`: event names, client/server event payloads, and shared DTOs
- `packages/game-core`: game manifests, layout keys, round phase helpers, and shared gameplay contracts
- `packages/ui-kit`: shared UI tokens
- `packages/utils`: generic utilities

## Core Rules

1. The server is the single source of truth.
2. Controllers send intent; they do not decide outcomes.
3. Host scenes render state; they do not own game rules.
4. Protocol types are the contract between all apps.
5. New games should live in optional game repos and expose only the documented package entrypoints.

## Runtime Flow

1. Host creates a room through `room:create`.
2. Server returns a room code and join URL.
3. Host displays the room code and QR overlay.
4. Phones join through the controller app.
5. Host selects a game from the available catalog.
6. Server starts and advances the round lifecycle.
7. Controller inputs flow through `game:input`.
8. Server broadcasts `game:state` or `game:patch`.
9. Host and controllers render the latest public state.
10. Server publishes scoreboard updates.

## Round Lifecycle

Room and round phases are shared across games:

- `lobby`
- `game_selected`
- `round_intro`
- `countdown`
- `playing`
- `locked`
- `result`
- `scoreboard`
- `finished`

Game-specific state should fit inside this lifecycle unless there is a strong reason to extend the platform.

## Registries

Main registry files:

- `config/known-games.json`
- `scripts/local-games.mjs`
- `apps/server/src/game-engine/gameRegistry.ts`
- `apps/host/src/games/registry.ts`
- `apps/controller/src/controller-ui/games/registry.tsx`

`npm run games:sync-local` generates optional registry imports from the local repos it finds. Missing optional game repos are normal and must not break `dev`, `typecheck`, or `build`.
