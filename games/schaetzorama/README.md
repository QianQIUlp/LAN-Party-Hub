## Status

Beta. The multi-category estimating loop is already good to play locally. Still needs question pool growth, scoring review, and controller UX polish before a stable release.

## Run Through Open Party Lab

This repo is not a standalone app. Run it through the Open Party Lab platform.

Recommended layout:

```text
Open-Party-Lab/
  local-games/
    schaetzorama/
```

From the Platform repo:

```bash
npm install
npm run games:sync-local
npm run dev:all
```

The Platform loads this game only when the repo exists locally and `npm run games:sync-local` links it. Missing optional games are skipped.
